# Technical Decisions

This document explains the key technical decisions made during the development of AutoDocs MCP Server, including the rationale behind each choice and the trade-offs considered.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Layered Architecture Pattern

**Decision**: Implement strict separation between infrastructure, core services, and application layers.

**Context**: The system needed to support multiple responsibilities (MCP protocol handling, caching, network operations, documentation processing) while maintaining clarity and testability.

**Rationale**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities, making the codebase easier to understand and modify
- **Dependency Inversion**: Higher layers depend on abstractions, enabling better testing through dependency injection
- **Evolution Support**: Layered architecture supports future changes like plugin systems or microservice decomposition
- **Testing Benefits**: Clear interfaces between layers enable comprehensive mocking and unit testing

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Complexity**: More structure than a simple single-file approach
- **Performance**: Additional abstraction layers could introduce overhead
- **Learning Curve**: New contributors need to understand the architectural patterns

**Outcome**: The layered architecture has proven valuable for maintainability and testing, with minimal performance impact due to Python's efficient function call overhead.

### Asynchronous-First Design

**Decision**: Use async/await throughout the entire system architecture.

**Context**: The system performs extensive I/O operations (file system access, HTTP requests, JSON processing) that would benefit from concurrency.

**Rationale**:
- **I/O Bound Operations**: Network requests to PyPI and file system operations are primary bottlenecks
- **Concurrency Benefits**: Async enables parallel processing of multiple package documentation requests
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better resource utilization compared to thread-based concurrency
- **Ecosystem Alignment**: Modern Python HTTP libraries (httpx) and MCP frameworks (FastMCP) are async-native

**Alternative Considered**:
- **Synchronous Design**: Simpler implementation but poor performance for concurrent operations
- **Thread-based Concurrency**: More complex error handling and resource management

**Implementation Details**:
- All core service methods are async
- Proper async context managers for resource management
- AsyncIO-compatible libraries throughout (httpx, aiofiles where applicable)
- Async-safe error handling patterns

**Outcome**: Async design enables efficient handling of concurrent documentation requests with clean, readable code.

## Caching Strategy Decisions

### Version-Based Immutable Caching

**Decision**: Use cache keys based on package name and exact version (`{package_name}-{version}.json`) with no time-based expiration.

**Context**: Package documentation and metadata for specific versions never changes once published to PyPI, but fetching from PyPI on every request would be inefficient.

**Rationale**:
- **Immutability Principle**: Package versions are immutable on PyPI - once published, the metadata never changes
- **Cache Efficiency**: No need for cache invalidation logic or TTL management
- **Performance Optimization**: Instant cache hits for repeated requests of the same package version
- **Storage Efficiency**: Only store data that will be reused, automatic garbage collection for unused versions

**Alternative Considered**:
- **Time-based Expiration**: Would require complex invalidation logic and could serve stale data
- **Package-based Caching**: Would miss version-specific optimizations

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Cache key format
cache_key = f"{package_name}-{resolved_version}.json"

# No expiration checking needed
def get_cached_docs(self, package_name: str, version: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    cache_path = self.cache_dir / f"{package_name}-{version}.json"
    if cache_path.exists():
        return json.loads(cache_path.read_text())
    return None
```

**Outcome**: Zero cache misses for previously fetched package versions, simplified cache management logic.

### JSON File-Based Cache Storage

**Decision**: Use local JSON files instead of database or in-memory caching.

**Context**: Needed persistent, efficient caching with minimal dependencies and setup complexity.

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: No additional database dependencies or setup requirements
- **Portability**: Cache works across different environments and installations
- **Transparency**: Cache contents are human-readable for debugging
- **Performance**: For typical usage patterns (hundreds of cached packages), file system performance is adequate
- **Reliability**: Less prone to corruption than database files

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **SQLite Database**: More complex setup, additional dependency, potential for corruption
- **In-Memory Caching**: Would lose cache between server restarts
- **Redis/External Cache**: Requires additional infrastructure setup

**Implementation Details**:
- One JSON file per cached package version
- Atomic write operations to prevent corruption
- Automatic corruption detection and recovery
- Configurable cache directory location

**Trade-offs**:
- **Scalability Limit**: File system performance may degrade with thousands of cached packages
- **Concurrency**: Requires file locking for concurrent access (future enhancement)

**Outcome**: Simple, reliable caching that meets current performance requirements with minimal complexity.

## Network Resilience Decisions

### Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation

**Decision**: Implement circuit breakers for all external API calls with exponential backoff and jitter.

**Context**: External APIs (PyPI) can experience outages or rate limiting, and naive retry strategies can worsen the situation through thundering herd effects.

**Rationale**:
- **Fault Tolerance**: Prevent cascading failures when external services are unavailable
- **User Experience**: Fail fast after detecting persistent issues rather than hanging indefinitely
- **System Stability**: Prevent resource exhaustion from continuous failed retry attempts
- **Respectful API Usage**: Avoid overwhelming external APIs with retry storms

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=30):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.recovery_timeout = recovery_timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
```

**Alternative Considered**:
- **Simple Retry Logic**: Would not prevent thundering herd or resource exhaustion
- **No Retry Logic**: Would provide poor user experience for transient failures

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple retry logic
- **Configuration**: Requires tuning of failure thresholds and timeouts

**Outcome**: Robust handling of external API failures with graceful degradation and automatic recovery.

### Connection Pooling Strategy

**Decision**: Use httpx with configured connection pools and automatic cleanup.

**Context**: Multiple HTTP requests to PyPI benefit from connection reuse, but connections need proper lifecycle management.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Connection reuse reduces overhead for multiple requests
- **Resource Management**: Proper connection limits prevent resource exhaustion
- **HTTP/2 Support**: httpx provides modern HTTP protocol support
- **Async Integration**: Native async support integrates well with the async architecture

**Implementation Details**:
```python
# Connection pool configuration
limits = httpx.Limits(
    max_keepalive_connections=20,
    max_connections=100,
    keepalive_expiry=30.0
)
client = httpx.AsyncClient(limits=limits, timeout=30.0)
```

**Alternative Considered**:
- **requests Library**: Synchronous-only, would require thread management
- **aiohttp**: Less mature than httpx, more complex API

**Outcome**: Efficient HTTP communication with proper resource management.

## Documentation Processing Decisions

### Context-Aware Documentation Filtering

**Decision**: Implement smart context selection based on AI model token limits and dependency relevance.

**Context**: Modern AI models have token limits (Claude: 200K, GPT-4: 128K), but comprehensive documentation for all dependencies would exceed these limits.

**Rationale**:
- **Token Budget Management**: Automatic context size management prevents AI model overload
- **Relevance Prioritization**: Most important dependencies selected first for maximum utility
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even with extensive dependency trees
- **User Control**: Configurable context scopes (primary_only, runtime, smart) for different use cases

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
def select_context_packages(
    dependencies: List[Package],
    max_tokens: int,
    scope: ContextScope
) -> List[Package]:
    # Priority scoring based on:
    # 1. Direct vs transitive dependencies
    # 2. Runtime vs development dependencies
    # 3. Package popularity/usage patterns
    # 4. Documentation quality assessment
```

**Alternative Considered**:
- **All Documentation**: Would exceed token limits for large projects
- **Primary Package Only**: Would miss important dependency context
- **Fixed Package Limits**: Less flexible than token-based budgeting

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: Sophisticated selection logic vs simple approaches
- **Subjectivity**: Relevance scoring requires heuristics and may miss edge cases

**Outcome**: Intelligent context selection that maximizes AI assistance within practical constraints.

## Protocol Integration Decisions

### FastMCP Framework Choice

**Decision**: Use FastMCP framework for MCP protocol implementation.

**Context**: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) requires strict stdio compliance and structured tool definitions.

**Rationale**:
- **Protocol Compliance**: FastMCP handles MCP protocol details correctly
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified tool definition with decorators and type hints
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling and response formatting
- **Community**: Active development and good documentation

**Alternative Considered**:
- **Manual MCP Implementation**: More control but significantly more complex
- **Other MCP Frameworks**: Less mature alternatives with limited documentation

**Implementation Benefits**:
- Automatic JSON-RPC handling
- Type-safe tool parameter validation
- Structured error responses
- stdio protocol compliance

**Outcome**: Reliable MCP protocol implementation with minimal boilerplate code.

### Stdio Transport Protocol

**Decision**: Use stdio transport for MCP communication rather than HTTP or other transport methods.

**Context**: MCP clients (like Cursor) expect stdio-based communication for local MCP servers.

**Rationale**:
- **Client Compatibility**: Cursor and other MCP clients use stdio by default
- **Simplicity**: No network configuration or port management required
- **Security**: No network exposure or authentication complexity
- **Integration**: Easy integration with shell scripts and process management

**Implementation Requirements**:
- All logging to stderr only (stdout reserved for MCP protocol)
- JSON-RPC message handling through stdin/stdout
- Graceful shutdown on stdin closure

**Alternative Considered**:
- **HTTP Transport**: Would require port management and network configuration
- **WebSocket**: More complex for local integrations

**Outcome**: Seamless integration with MCP clients and simple deployment model.

## Error Handling Philosophy

### Graceful Degradation Strategy

**Decision**: Continue processing with partial failures rather than failing completely.

**Context**: Documentation fetching can fail for individual packages while others succeed, and the system should provide maximum utility even with partial data.

**Rationale**:
- **User Experience**: Partial results are better than complete failure
- **Resilience**: System remains useful during external service issues
- **Debugging**: Clear error reporting for failed operations enables troubleshooting
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works even when advanced features fail

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
async def fetch_multiple_packages(packages: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    results = {}
    errors = []

    for package in packages:
        try:
            results[package] = await fetch_package_docs(package)
        except Exception as e:
            errors.append(f"Failed to fetch {package}: {str(e)}")
            continue

    return {
        "successful_packages": results,
        "errors": errors,
        "success": len(results) > 0
    }
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: More complex than fail-fast approaches
- **Partial State**: Clients must handle partial success responses

**Outcome**: Robust system behavior that provides maximum utility under adverse conditions.

## Performance Optimization Decisions

### Concurrent Processing with Limits

**Decision**: Process multiple documentation requests concurrently with configurable concurrency limits.

**Context**: Fetching documentation for large dependency trees benefits from parallel processing, but unlimited concurrency can overwhelm external APIs.

**Rationale**:
- **Performance**: Significant speedup for projects with many dependencies
- **API Respect**: Limits prevent overwhelming PyPI or other external services
- **Resource Control**: Prevents memory/connection exhaustion
- **Configurability**: Allows tuning for different environments and use cases

**Implementation**:
```python
# Semaphore-based concurrency control
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_requests)

async def fetch_with_limit(package: str) -> Dict:
    async with semaphore:
        return await fetch_package_docs(package)

# Process packages concurrently
tasks = [fetch_with_limit(pkg) for pkg in packages]
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `max_concurrent_requests`: Maximum simultaneous API calls
- `request_timeout`: Timeout for individual requests
- `rate_limit_delay`: Minimum delay between requests

**Outcome**: Optimal performance while respecting external API limits and system resources.

## Future Architecture Evolution

### Plugin Architecture Readiness

**Decision**: Design current architecture to support future plugin-based extensions.

**Context**: While not currently implemented, the architecture should enable future plugin capabilities for custom documentation sources, processing pipelines, or AI integrations.

**Design Principles**:
- **Interface Segregation**: Clear service interfaces suitable for plugin implementation
- **Dependency Injection**: Configuration-driven service instantiation
- **Event System**: Foundation for plugin lifecycle management
- **Configuration Schema**: Extensible configuration for plugin parameters

**Preparation Steps**:
```python
# Service interfaces designed for plugin implementation
class DocumentationSource(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def fetch_docs(self, package: str, version: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        pass

# Configuration system ready for plugin config
class PluginConfig(BaseModel):
    enabled_plugins: List[str] = []
    plugin_config: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Future Flexibility**: Easy addition of new documentation sources
- **Customization**: Users can extend functionality for specific needs
- **Community Contributions**: Plugin system enables community-driven extensions

This architectural foundation provides a robust, scalable system that can evolve with changing requirements while maintaining reliability and performance.
