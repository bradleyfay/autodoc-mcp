# Development Process

Welcome to the AutoDocs MCP Server development documentation. This section provides comprehensive guidance for contributors, technical reviewers, and anyone wanting to understand or work with the codebase.

## Quick Navigation

### For New Contributors
- **[Contributing Guide](contributing.md)** - Start here for contribution workflow, setup, and pull request process
- **[Development Standards](standards.md)** - Code conventions, commit message standards, and quality requirements

### For Architecture Understanding
- **[System Architecture](architecture.md)** - Layered architecture, component design, and module organization
- **[Technical Decisions](technical-decisions.md)** - Key design choices, rationale, and trade-offs made

### For Testing and Quality
- **[Testing Guide](testing.md)** - Testing standards, patterns, and requirements for maintaining code quality

## Development Philosophy

AutoDocs MCP Server follows a **production-first development approach** with emphasis on:

- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Efficient caching, concurrent processing, and resource management
- **Quality**: Strict testing standards, type safety, and code consistency
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and well-documented architectural decisions

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 Complete ✅
**Test Coverage**: 91%
**Type Checking**: Clean (0 MyPy errors)
**Technical Debt**: All high-priority items resolved

## Development Environment

The project uses modern Python tooling for optimal developer experience:

- **Package Manager**: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable dependency management
- **Testing**: [pytest](https://pytest.org/) with comprehensive plugin ecosystem
- **Type Checking**: [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) with strict configuration
- **Linting**: [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for fast, comprehensive code analysis
- **Pre-commit**: Automated quality checks on every commit

## Key Implementation Features

### MCP Protocol Integration
- 8 comprehensive MCP tools for dependency analysis and documentation
- Strict stdio protocol compliance with structured error handling
- Production-ready health checks and monitoring capabilities

### Advanced Caching System
- Version-based immutable cache keys for maximum efficiency
- Concurrent documentation fetching with connection pooling
- Automatic cache validation and corruption recovery

### Network Resilience
- Circuit breakers with exponential backoff for API reliability
- Comprehensive retry strategies for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

### Documentation Context Intelligence
- Smart dependency scoping for relevant context selection
- Token budget management for AI model compatibility
- Runtime vs development dependency classification

## Getting Started as a Contributor

1. **Read the [Contributing Guide](contributing.md)** for setup and workflow
2. **Review [Development Standards](standards.md)** for code conventions
3. **Understand the [Architecture](architecture.md)** for component organization
4. **Follow [Testing Guidelines](testing.md)** for quality assurance

## Documentation Principles

This development documentation follows the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/):

- **Tutorials** - Learning-oriented, step-by-step guidance
- **How-to Guides** - Problem-solving recipes for specific tasks
- **Explanations** - Understanding-oriented context and design rationale
- **Reference** - Information-oriented specifications and lookups

Each document type serves different user needs and learning contexts.

## Support and Communication

- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests
- **Technical Questions**: Include context about your development environment and specific challenges
- **Architecture Discussions**: Reference relevant technical decision documents when proposing changes

The codebase is designed to be self-documenting with comprehensive inline comments and clear module organization. When in doubt, the source code is the authoritative reference.
