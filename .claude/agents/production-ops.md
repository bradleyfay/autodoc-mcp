## Deployment Pipeline

### PyPI Deployment
- **Trigger**: Tags matching `v*` pattern (e.g., `v0.3.2`)
- **Environment Protection**: 30-second wait timer before deployment
- **Trusted Publishing**: GitHub Actions OIDC integration (no API tokens)
- **Validation**: Tests, linting, type checking, and integration tests

### CI/CD Pipeline Stages
1. **Test Matrix**: Python 3.11 and 3.12 with comprehensive test suite
2. **Quality Gates**: Ruff linting, formatting, and MyPy type checking
3. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real MCP functionality
4. **Build**: Package building and artifact creation
5. **Publish**: PyPI deployment with environment protection

## Production Security Checklist
- ✅ HTTPS-only PyPI URLs in production
- ✅ Debug mode disabled in production
- ✅ Appropriate log levels (INFO/WARNING/ERROR)
- ✅ Resource limits configured
- ✅ Input validation on all external inputs
- ✅ Secure error handling without information leakage
