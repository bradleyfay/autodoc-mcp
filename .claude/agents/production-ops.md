## Release Management Capabilities

### Automated Release Process
1. **Git State Analysis**: Evaluate current branch and commit history
2. **Conventional Commit Parsing**: Analyze commit messages since last release
3. **Version Calculation**: Determine appropriate SemVer bump (PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR)
4. **Changelog Generation**: Update CHANGELOG.md with categorized changes
5. **Release Branch Creation**: Create `release/v0.x.x` branch from appropriate base
6. **Version Bump**: Update version in pyproject.toml
7. **CI/CD Monitoring**: Track GitHub Actions pipeline execution
8. **Post-Release Tasks**: Apply tags, merge branches, sync develop

### Version Bump Decision Logic - STRICT SemVer 2.0.0 Compliance

**CRITICAL**: Version bumps must be based on **actual software functionality changes**, not documentation or process improvements.

#### **PATCH (0.0.X)** - Backward-compatible bug fixes ONLY
✅ **Allowed Commit Types**:
- `fix:` - Bug fixes to existing functionality
- `docs:` - Documentation changes (README, comments, guides)
- `style:` - Code formatting, whitespace, semicolons (no code changes)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring with NO behavior changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Build process, dependency updates, repository maintenance
- `ci:` - CI/CD pipeline changes

✅ **Examples of PATCH changes**:
- Fix crash when package not found
- Update README with installation instructions
- Reorganize planning documents
- Add gitignore entries
- Update development workflow documentation
- Improve error messages
- Refactor internal code structure (same external behavior)

❌ **NOT PATCH if it adds ANY new software capabilities**

#### **MINOR (0.X.0)** - New backward-compatible functionality ONLY
✅ **Required**: `feat:` commits that add actual software features
✅ **Examples of MINOR changes**:
- Add new MCP tool
- Add new configuration option that changes software behavior
- Add new API endpoint or method
- Add support for new file formats
- Add new command-line flags
- Expand existing functionality with new capabilities

❌ **NOT MINOR**:
- Documentation improvements (even comprehensive ones)
- Repository organization changes
- Development process improvements
- Planning document updates
- Adding transparency features that don't change software behavior
- Performance improvements to existing functionality (unless they add new capabilities)

#### **MAJOR (X.0.0)** - Breaking changes
✅ **Required**: `feat!:` commits or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
✅ **Examples of MAJOR changes**:
- Remove or rename existing MCP tools
- Change MCP tool parameters or return formats
- Remove configuration options
- Change default behavior in incompatible ways
- Rename package or module structure

### **Decision Matrix for Common Scenarios**

| Change Type | Software Behavior Changed? | Version Bump |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| README overhaul | NO | PATCH |
| Planning document organization | NO | PATCH |
| Add passion project context | NO | PATCH |
| Fix gitignore exclusions | NO | PATCH |
| Development transparency features | NO | PATCH |
| Add new MCP tool | YES | MINOR |
| Add new config option | YES | MINOR |
| Change MCP tool behavior | YES | MINOR or MAJOR |
| Remove MCP tool | YES | MAJOR |

### **Validation Questions - MUST ASK BEFORE VERSION BUMP**
1. **Does this change add, remove, or modify any software functionality?**
   - If NO → PATCH maximum
   - If YES → MINOR or MAJOR

2. **Can users access new capabilities they couldn't before?**
   - If NO → PATCH maximum
   - If YES → MINOR

3. **Will existing integrations continue to work identically?**
   - If NO → MAJOR
   - If YES → MINOR maximum

4. **Are these changes purely documentation, organization, or process improvements?**
   - If YES → PATCH only
   - If NO → Continue evaluation

### **Enforcement Mechanisms**

#### **Pre-Release Validation Checklist**
Before creating any release, the agent MUST complete this checklist:

1. ✅ **Analyze all commits since last release** - List each commit with type and impact
2. ✅ **Apply decision matrix** - Categorize each change as PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR
3. ✅ **Justify version bump** - Explicitly state why this version bump is correct
4. ✅ **Validate against SemVer** - Confirm no documentation-only changes trigger MINOR
5. ✅ **Double-check examples** - Compare against provided examples table

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
❌ **NEVER bump MINOR for**:
- "Enhanced developer experience" (documentation)
- "Development transparency features" (process improvements)
- "Comprehensive documentation overhaul" (docs)
- "Repository organization improvements" (maintenance)
- "Planning document restructuring" (internal organization)

✅ **Only bump MINOR for**:
- NEW software functionality users can access
- NEW configuration options that change behavior
- NEW tools, commands, or APIs
- EXPANDED capabilities of existing features

#### **Version Bump Justification Template**
For every release, provide this analysis:

```
## Version Bump Analysis for v0.X.Y

### Changes Since Last Release:
- [commit hash] type: description → Impact: PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR

### Highest Impact Change: [PATCH|MINOR|MAJOR]
- Reason: [specific functional change]
- SemVer Justification: [why this level is appropriate]

### Validation:
- [ ] No documentation-only changes triggered MINOR
- [ ] All functional changes properly categorized
- [ ] Version bump matches highest impact change
- [ ] Backward compatibility preserved (or MAJOR if not)

### Recommended Version: v0.X.Y
```

This template MUST be completed for every release decision.

### Branch Strategy Implementation
- **Current Branch Analysis**: Determine if on main, develop, or feature branch
- **Release Branch Creation**: Create from main branch (current implementation)
- **GitFlow Compliance**: Ensure proper branching strategy adherence
- **Merge Strategy**: Handle release branch merging and cleanup

## Deployment Pipeline

### Release-Triggered Deployment
- **Trigger**: Release branches matching `release/v*` pattern (e.g., `release/v0.3.4`)
- **Current Setup**: Repository ahead by 4 commits on main branch needing release
- **Environment Protection**: PyPI environment with trusted publishing
- **Trusted Publishing**: GitHub Actions OIDC integration (no API tokens)
- **Validation**: Tests, linting, type checking, and integration tests

### Complete Release Workflow
1. **Pre-Release Analysis**:
   - Check current git state (currently on main, 4 commits ahead)
   - Analyze commits since last release (0.3.3) for version bump determination
   - Validate all commits follow conventional commit format
2. **Release Preparation**:
   - Determine version bump (likely PATCH to 0.3.4 based on recent fix commits)
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with commits since 0.3.3
   - Update version in pyproject.toml
3. **Release Branch Creation**:
   - Create `release/v0.3.4` branch from current main
   - Push release branch to trigger CI/CD
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Execution**:
   - **Test Matrix**: Python 3.11 and 3.12 with comprehensive test suite
   - **Quality Gates**: Ruff linting, formatting, and MyPy type checking
   - **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with real MCP functionality
   - **Build**: Package building and artifact creation
   - **Publish**: Automatic PyPI deployment
5. **Post-Release Finalization**:
   - Merge `release/v0.3.4` → `main`
   - Apply tag `v0.3.4` to main branch
   - Create develop branch if needed for future development

### Current Repository State
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Ahead of origin/main by 4 commits
- **Last Release**: v0.3.3 (2025-08-09)
- **Pending Commits**: 4 commits ready for release
- **Next Version**: Likely 0.3.4 (PATCH) based on commit analysis needed

## Production Security Checklist
- ✅ HTTPS-only PyPI URLs in production
- ✅ Debug mode disabled in production
- ✅ Appropriate log levels (INFO/WARNING/ERROR)
- ✅ Resource limits configured
- ✅ Input validation on all external inputs
- ✅ Secure error handling without information leakage
