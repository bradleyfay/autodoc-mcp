# Agent content in markdown format
```

## Usage in Claude Code

These agents are designed to be used with Claude Code's Task tool for specialized assistance:

```
Use the Task tool with subagent_type parameter to invoke specific agents:
- For core development: use "core-services"
- For documentation: use "docs-integration" or "technical-writer"
- For testing: use "testing-specialist"
- For deployment: use "production-ops"
- For complex workflows: use "workflow-orchestrator"
```

## Agent Selection Guidelines

- **Single-domain tasks**: Use the appropriate specialist agent directly
- **Multi-step workflows**: Consider using workflow-orchestrator to coordinate multiple agents
- **Project setup/resumption**: Use project-planning-steward for proper organization
- **Architecture decisions**: Use agent-design-architect for system design questions

All agents are fully functional and ready for use in the AutoDocs MCP Server development workflow.
