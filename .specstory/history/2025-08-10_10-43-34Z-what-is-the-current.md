What is the current state of my repo and where am I at in the work that I need to do on this?

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)**_

Looking at your repository, I can see you're working on the **AutoDocs MCP Server** project and you're currently on the `develop` branch with several changes staged and modified.

## Current Repository State

**Branch**: `develop` (good - following the GitFlow workflow)

**Modified Files**:
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documentation updates
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration changes
- Core server files (`main.py`, `observability.py`) 
- Multiple test files updated
- New planning documents for a **Task Graph System**

**Recently Added**:
- Complete task graph system planning in `planning/TASK_GRAPH_SYSTEM/`
  - Agent specifications for orchestration and task graph construction
  - Technical architecture documentation  
  - Implementation plans and user guides

## Project Status: Phase 4 Complete ✅

Your AutoDocs MCP Server is **fully implemented** with all 4 phases complete:
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Core dependency parsing and MCP integration
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Documentation fetching with PyPI integration  
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Network resilience and graceful degradation
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Smart dependency context with token management

## What You're Working On

Based on the planning documents, you appear to be designing a **Task Graph System** - an advanced multi-agent orchestration system that goes beyond the current AutoDocs functionality. This looks like a significant architectural expansion.

The system includes:
- **Orchestration Manager Agent**: Coordinates complex multi-step tasks
- **Task Graph Constructor Agent**: Builds dependency graphs for task execution
- Advanced task decomposition and parallel execution capabilities

## Next Steps

Since you have uncommitted changes, you should decide whether to:
1. **Commit current work**: The planning documents and test updates
2. **Continue development**: On the task graph system implementation  
3. **Review and prioritize**: What specific aspect needs attention next

Would you like me to help with any specific aspect - committing changes, implementing the task graph system, or something else?
