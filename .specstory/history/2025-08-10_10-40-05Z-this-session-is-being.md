_**User**_

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation to capture all the essential details:

1. **Initial User Request**: The user asked me to "dispatch a series of agents to investigate each file individually and in parallel" to fix broken code/tests, focusing on single file pairs (code and tests) and stopping when tests are working.

2. **My Approach**: I created a systematic approach using TodoWrite to track progress, then dispatched multiple Task agents in parallel to investigate specific code/test file pairs.

3. **Investigation Phase**: I first mapped the project structure, found 398 tests with 391 passing and 7 skipped, but identified 43+ warnings that needed fixing.

4. **Parallel Agent Dispatch**: I dispatched 5 specialist testing agents to work on:
   - cache_manager code/test pair
   - context_fetcher code/test pair  
   - doc_fetcher code/test pair
   - health code/test pair
   - main_server code/test pair

5. **Agent Results**: Each agent successfully fixed their assigned issues:
   - Fixed pytest-mock context manager warnings
   - Added missing test coverage
   - Fixed AsyncMock coroutine warnings
   - Added missing @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators
   - Fixed integration test reliability

6. **Additional Agent Dispatch**: I then dispatched more agents for remaining files (config, observability, security, etc.) and they all completed successfully.

7. **Release Creation Request**: The user then asked me to "bundle all of these changes into a new release that fixes the bugs that were introduced in 0.4.1 and deploy that release".

8. **Release Process**: I executed a complete release workflow:
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with detailed bug fixes for v0.4.2
   - Bumped version in pyproject.toml to 0.4.2
   - Committed changes with conventional commit message
   - Created release/v0.4.2 branch
   - Merged to main and tagged v0.4.2
   - Pushed to trigger CI/CD deployment

9. **CI/CD Issue Discovery**: While monitoring the deployment, I discovered a test failure in the CI pipeline on Python 3.12, specifically a `TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not subscriptable` error in version_resolver.py where `response.json()` is not being awaited.

This is where the conversation was interrupted, with me having identified the bug that needs to be fixed for the deployment to succeed.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user's primary request was to "dispatch a series of agents to investigate each file individually and in parallel. The agents should focus on a single file pair (code and tests) alone. And stop when they have verified that the tests for their specific file are working based on updates to the relevant code." After completing this investigation and fixes, the user then requested to "bundle all of these changes into a new release that fixes the bugs that were introduced in 0.4.1 and deploy that release."

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - pytest-mock patterns vs unittest.mock (project mandates pytest-mock exclusively)
   - AsyncMock coroutine handling and proper async test patterns
   - @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators for integration tests
   - Context manager usage patterns with pytest-mock
   - Statistical percentile calculation algorithms (R-7 quantile method)
   - Semantic versioning and conventional commit messages
   - GitFlow workflow with release branches
   - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and PyPI deployment
   - Network resilience and HTTP client response handling

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - **CHANGELOG.md**
     - Updated with comprehensive v0.4.2 release notes documenting all bug fixes
     - Added detailed technical improvements and warnings reduction metrics
     
   - **pyproject.toml** 
     - Version bumped from 0.4.1 to 0.4.2
     
   - **src/autodoc_mcp/main.py**
     - Fixed indentation error in get_package_docs_with_context function
     
   - **src/autodoc_mcp/observability.py**
     - Fixed percentile calculation algorithm with proper statistical method:
     ```python
     def percentile(values: list[float], p: float) -> float:
         """Calculate the p-th percentile of values."""
         if not values:
             return 0.0
         # Use linear interpolation method (R-7 quantile method)
         index = (n - 1) * p
         lower_idx = int(index)
         upper_idx = min(lower_idx + 1, n - 1)
         if lower_idx == upper_idx:
             return values[lower_idx]
         # Interpolate between lower and upper values
         weight = index - lower_idx
         return values[lower_idx] * (1 - weight) + values[upper_idx] * weight
     ```
     
   - **tests/unit/test_config_validation.py**
     - Converted from unittest.mock to pytest-mock patterns
     - Removed forbidden `from unittest.mock import patch`
     - Updated all test methods to use `mocker` fixture
     
   - **tests/unit/test_cache_manager.py**
     - Fixed 3 pytest-mock context manager warnings
     - Converted context managers to direct mock assignments with assertions
     
   - **tests/unit/test_doc_fetcher.py** 
     - Fixed 8+ pytest-mock context manager warnings across all test classes
     
   - **tests/unit/test_health.py**
     - Fixed pytest-mock context manager usage in test_get_readiness_status_ready
     
   - **tests/unit/test_main_server.py**
     - Fixed AsyncMock usage warnings and indentation issues
     - Corrected register_signals mocking from AsyncMock to regular MagicMock
     
   - **tests/integration/test_phase4_context.py**
     - Added missing @pytest.mark.asyncio decorators to 7 async test methods
     - Enhanced error classification for better network test skipping
     
   - **tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py**
     - Improved exception handling to distinguish network errors from event loop closure issues
     
   - **src/autodoc_mcp/core/version_resolver.py** (CURRENT ISSUE)
     - Bug discovered: line 36 has `data = response.json()` which should be `data = await response.json()`

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Pytest-mock context manager warnings**: Fixed by removing unnecessary `with` statements from mocker.patch calls across multiple test files
   - **AsyncMock coroutine warnings**: Fixed by properly configuring mock return values and using correct mock types
   - **Missing async decorators**: Added @pytest.mark.asyncio to 7 integration test methods
   - **Percentile calculation bug**: Replaced incorrect array indexing with proper statistical linear interpolation method
   - **Standards violations**: Converted unittest.mock usage to mandatory pytest-mock patterns
   - **CI/CD test failure**: Discovered TypeError in version_resolver.py where response.json() coroutine is not awaited

5. Problem Solving:
   Successfully orchestrated parallel investigation of 17 code/test file pairs, achieving 396/401 tests passing (98.8% success rate) and reducing warnings from 43+ to 3. Created and deployed v0.4.2 release but discovered a critical bug in CI that prevents deployment completion.

6. All user messages:
   - "The code/tests are broken. Dispatch a series of agents to investigate each file individually and in parallel. The agents should focus on a single file pair (code and tests) alone. And stop when they have verified that the tests for their specific file are working based on updates to the relevant code"
   - "[Request interrupted by user]The code/tests are broken. Dispatch a series of agents to investigate each file individually and in parallel. The agents should focus on a single file pair (code and tests) alone. And stop when they have verified that the tests for their specific file are working based on updates to the relevant code"
   - "nice work. Now I want you to bundle all of these changes into a new release that fixes the bugs that were introduced in 0.4.1 and deploy that release"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Fix the critical bug in src/autodoc_mcp/core/version_resolver.py line 36 where `response.json()` needs to be awaited
   - Complete the v0.4.2 release deployment after fixing the CI test failure

8. Current Work:
   I was monitoring the v0.4.2 release deployment and discovered a critical test failure in the CI/CD pipeline on Python 3.12. The specific error is `TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not subscriptable` in src/autodoc_mcp/core/version_resolver.py at line 36 where `data = response.json()` should be `data = await response.json()`. This bug is preventing the release from completing its deployment to PyPI.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Fix the version_resolver.py bug by changing line 36 from `data = response.json()` to `data = await response.json()`, commit the fix, and push to complete the v0.4.2 release deployment. This directly addresses the CI failure that's blocking the release the user requested..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

I can see that `get_with_retry` returns a raw `httpx.Response` object. The issue is that we need to call `response.json()` without await, since httpx.Response.json() is a synchronous method. Let me fix this:

```
