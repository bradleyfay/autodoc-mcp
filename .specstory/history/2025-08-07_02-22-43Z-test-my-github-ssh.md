I'll test your GitHub SSH configuration to verify it's working properly.

Tool use: **Bash** Test GitHub SSH authentication

`ssh -T git@github.com`

Error:

```
Hi bradleyfay! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)**_

Your GitHub SSH configuration is working correctly. The message "You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access" is the expected response from GitHub when testing SSH authentication - it confirms your SSH key is properly configured and authenticated.
