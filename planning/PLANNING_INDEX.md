## 📚 System Guide

### For AI Agents
1. **Project Work**: Start with `projects/{project}/PROJECT_INDEX.md` for project-specific context
2. **Cross-Project Work**: Begin with `cross-project/AGENT_CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE.md` for coordination patterns
3. **Standards Application**: Reference `cross-project/shared_standards.md` for consistency
4. **Architecture Understanding**: Review `cross-project/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` for system design

### For Developers & Contributors
1. **Getting Started**: Read [Development Philosophy](cross-project/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md) for core principles
2. **Project Context**: Navigate to specific project's `PROJECT_INDEX.md` for detailed information
3. **Standards Compliance**: Follow [Shared Standards](cross-project/shared_standards.md) for all contributions
4. **Architecture Understanding**: Study [Architecture Overview](cross-project/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md) for system design

### For Open Source Community
1. **Project Overview**: Start with this document for portfolio understanding
2. **Technical Deep Dive**: Explore individual project documentation in `projects/`
3. **Contribution Guidelines**: Review development philosophy and standards
4. **Research Insights**: Check Task Graph System for cutting-edge AI agent research

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Directory Structure Philosophy
```
planning/
├── projects/           # Project-first organization
│   ├── [project-a]/   # Complete project context
│   └── [project-b]/   # Consistent internal structure
├── cross-project/     # Portfolio coordination
├── templates/         # Standardized processes
└── archived/          # Historical preservation
```

### Benefits of This Structure
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each project has dedicated space
- **Consistent Patterns**: Same organization across all projects
- **Scalable Growth**: Easy to add new projects
- **Portfolio View**: Cross-project coordination and visibility

### Migration from Legacy Structure
The previous flat structure has been reorganized into this project-centric approach:
- Old `CORE_REFERENCE/` → `projects/autodocs-mcp/reference/`
- Old `IMPLEMENTATION/` → `projects/autodocs-mcp/active/`
- Old `TASK_GRAPH_SYSTEM/` → `projects/task-graph-system/`
