- [ ] Last updated timestamp is recent

**Environment Validation**:
- [ ] Development environment matches documented state
- [ ] No unexpected changes to project files
- [ ] Dependencies and external services functional
- [ ] Testing environment consistent with expectations

#### Step 2: Context Refresh
**Information Update Review**:
