## Usage Examples

### Example 1: New Project Creation
```bash
# Planning-specialist agent workflow for new project creation

# 1. Scope Assessment (5-10 minutes)
# - Define project mission and objectives
# - Establish scope boundaries and exclusions
# - Identify dependencies and constraints

# 2. Structure Setup (5 minutes)
cp -r planning/templates/AI_AGENT_PROJECT_TEMPLATE planning/projects/new-api-project
cd planning/projects/new-api-project

# 3. Template Customization
# - Replace placeholders with project information
# - Initialize PROJECT_STATE.md with current phase
# - Complete SCOPE_DEFINITION.md with boundaries
# - Fill AGENT_CONTEXT.md with essential background

# 4. Integration Setup
# - Add to PLANNING_INDEX.md
# - Update PROJECT_COORDINATION.md if needed
# - Establish cross-project dependencies

# Result: Project ready for any agent to begin work
```

### Example 2: Project Handoff Scenario
```yaml
# Agent A completing work session
handoff_preparation:
  - update_project_state: "Current completion, blocking issues, next actions"
  - document_session_work: "Record decisions and implementations in log"
  - validate_context: "Ensure AGENT_CONTEXT.md is current"
  - prepare_environment: "Clean state for next agent"

# Agent B beginning new session
handoff_acquisition:
  - read_project_state: "Understand current status and next actions"
  - review_agent_context: "Get essential background knowledge"
  - validate_environment: "Confirm development environment ready"
  - begin_productive_work: "Start executing next actions"

# Success metrics
handoff_quality:
  - context_acquisition_time: "< 5 minutes"
  - clarification_requests: "0"
  - productive_work_start: "< 10 minutes total"
```

### Example 3: Cross-Project Coordination
```yaml
# Resource conflict scenario
conflict_situation:
  project_a: "AutoDocs MCP needs intensive testing before release"
  project_b: "Documentation Site needs technical examples from AutoDocs"
  resource_constraint: "Limited capacity for both intensive testing and example creation"

resolution_process:
  1. priority_assessment: "AutoDocs release is higher priority"
  2. coordination_opportunity: "Use testing process to create documentation examples"
  3. resource_optimization: "Documentation agent can observe and document testing"
  4. timeline_coordination: "Sequence work to benefit both projects"

outcome:
  - AutoDocs gets needed testing with higher priority
  - Documentation Site gets authentic examples from real testing
  - Efficient resource utilization across both projects
```
