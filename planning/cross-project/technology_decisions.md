## üêç Python Technology Stack

### Core Language & Runtime
- **Python Version**: 3.12+ (latest stable)
- **Package Manager**: `uv` (fast, modern Python package management)
- **Virtual Environment**: `uv venv` for isolated development environments
- **Dependency Resolution**: `uv` with `pyproject.toml` configuration

**Rationale**: Python 3.12 provides excellent performance and modern features. `uv` offers significant speed improvements over pip/pipenv while maintaining compatibility.

### Web Framework & API Development
- **MCP Server Framework**: `FastMCP` - Specialized for MCP protocol implementation
- **Alternative Web Framework**: `FastAPI` - If non-MCP web APIs needed
- **Async Runtime**: Built-in `asyncio` with async/await patterns
- **HTTP Client**: `httpx` - Modern async HTTP client with excellent features

**Rationale**: FastMCP provides MCP-specific optimizations. FastAPI offers excellent async support, automatic documentation, and type safety. httpx is the modern standard for async HTTP.

### Data & Validation
- **Data Models**: `Pydantic v2` - Type-safe data validation and serialization
- **Configuration**: `Pydantic Settings` - Environment-aware configuration management
- **JSON Processing**: Standard library `json` with Pydantic serialization
- **File Formats**: `toml` library for pyproject.toml parsing

**Rationale**: Pydantic v2 provides excellent performance, type safety, and validation capabilities. Native integration with FastAPI and modern Python practices.

### Database & Caching (When Needed)
- **File-based Caching**: JSON files with atomic writes (current AutoDocs approach)
- **Future Database**: `SQLite` with `SQLModel` for simple relational needs
- **Advanced Database**: `PostgreSQL` with `asyncpg` for complex requirements
- **Redis**: For distributed caching if multi-instance deployment needed

**Rationale**: Start simple with file-based caching, scale up to SQLite, then PostgreSQL as needed. SQLModel provides Pydantic integration with SQL databases.

## üåê Web Development Stack

### Frontend Framework
- **Primary Choice**: `Next.js` (React-based) for full-stack applications
- **Alternative**: `Vite + React` for SPA applications
- **Styling**: `Tailwind CSS` for utility-first styling
- **Component Library**: `Shadcn/ui` or `Chakra UI` for consistent components

**Rationale**: Next.js provides excellent developer experience, SSR/SSG capabilities, and strong ecosystem. Tailwind CSS offers rapid development with consistent design.

### TypeScript & Tooling
- **Language**: `TypeScript` for type safety and better developer experience
- **Build Tool**: `Vite` (standalone) or Next.js build system
- **Package Manager**: `npm` or `yarn` with lock files
- **Bundling**: Built-in bundling with framework tools

**Rationale**: TypeScript prevents many runtime errors and improves code maintainability. Modern build tools provide excellent developer experience.

### State Management & API
- **State Management**: React Context API for simple state, `Zustand` for complex
- **API Calls**: `fetch` API with TypeScript wrappers
- **Form Handling**: `React Hook Form` with validation
- **Routing**: Framework-provided routing (Next.js Router, React Router)

**Rationale**: Start simple with Context API, scale to Zustand as needed. Native fetch API is now sufficient for most HTTP needs.

## ü§ñ AI & ML Integration

### AI Model Integration
- **Primary AI Provider**: OpenAI API (Claude via Anthropic API)
- **MCP Protocol**: Core protocol for AI tool integration
- **Model Context Protocol**: `FastMCP` library for server implementation
- **AI Development**: Claude Code as primary development environment

**Rationale**: Focus on MCP protocol for maximum compatibility with AI development environments. OpenAI/Anthropic APIs provide reliable, high-quality AI capabilities.

### AI-Specific Libraries
- **OpenAI Client**: `openai` Python library
- **Anthropic Client**: `anthropic` Python library
- **Text Processing**: Standard library `re`, `json` for simple needs
- **Advanced NLP**: Consider `spaCy` or `transformers` if needed

**Rationale**: Official client libraries provide best support and reliability. Avoid complex NLP libraries unless specifically needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Quality Tools

### Code Quality & Formatting
- **Formatter**: `Ruff` (replaces Black, isort, Flake8, and many plugins)
- **Type Checker**: `MyPy` with strict configuration
- **Pre-commit**: `pre-commit` hooks for automated quality checks
- **Git Hooks**: Enforce quality standards before commits

**Rationale**: Ruff consolidates many tools into one fast, reliable solution. MyPy provides excellent type checking with gradual adoption.

### Testing Framework
- **Test Runner**: `pytest` - Industry standard with excellent plugin ecosystem
- **Async Testing**: `pytest-asyncio` for async/await test support
- **Mocking**: `pytest-mock` (never use `unittest.mock` directly)
- **HTTP Testing**: `pytest-httpx` for HTTP client mocking
- **Coverage**: `pytest-cov` with coverage reporting
- **Parallel Testing**: `pytest-xdist` for faster test execution

**Rationale**: pytest ecosystem is mature, comprehensive, and provides excellent developer experience. Plugin system allows customization without complexity.

### Documentation & API Tools
- **API Documentation**: `OpenAPI` (Swagger) for REST APIs
- **MCP Documentation**: JSON Schema for MCP tool definitions
- **Code Documentation**: Python docstrings with Google style
- **Project Documentation**: Markdown files with consistent structure

**Rationale**: Industry standard documentation formats ensure compatibility and tooling support.

## üöÄ Deployment & Operations

### Containerization & Deployment
- **Current Deployment**: Direct Python package installation (`pip install -e .`)
- **Future Containerization**: `Docker` with multi-stage builds if needed
- **Process Management**: `systemd` for Linux deployments
- **Package Distribution**: `PyPI` for Python packages

**Rationale**: Start simple with direct installation, containerize when deployment complexity requires it.

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Logging**: Python `structlog` for structured logging
- **Metrics**: Custom metrics collection with JSON format
- **Health Checks**: HTTP endpoints for health and readiness
- **Error Tracking**: Built-in error handling with structured logging

**Rationale**: Structured logging provides better observability. Simple metrics collection avoids vendor lock-in.

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Version Control**: `Git` with GitHub
- **CI/CD Platform**: `GitHub Actions` for automation
- **Automated Testing**: Full test suite execution on every PR
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks + CI validation
- **Deployment**: Automated PyPI publication for Python packages

**Rationale**: GitHub Actions integrates well with GitHub repositories and provides sufficient capabilities for current needs.
