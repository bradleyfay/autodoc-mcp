# Technical Debt Tracking

This document tracks technical debt items that need to be addressed to improve code quality, maintainability, and consistency.

## Current Status: TECHNICAL DEBT RESOLVED ✅

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-09
**Status**: All high-priority technical debt has been resolved
**Test Coverage**: 91% (target: >80%)
**MyPy Status**: Clean (0 errors)
**Build Status**: All quality gates passing

## Current Debt Items

### Medium Priority

#### Mock Context Manager Warnings (Created: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: Some tests use `with mocker.patch()` as context managers, generating warnings
- **Impact**: Test output noise, minor developer experience issue
- **Root Cause**: Valid usage pattern that generates false positive warnings
- **Solution**: Consider refactoring specific tests to avoid context manager usage where not needed
- **Files Affected**: Tests in cache_manager.py, doc_fetcher.py, health.py
- **Effort**: Low (1 hour)
- **Priority**: Medium (cosmetic issue, doesn't affect functionality)

#### Async Test Cleanup Warnings (Created: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: Some async tests have RuntimeWarnings about unawaited coroutines
- **Impact**: Test output noise, potential test reliability concerns
- **Solution**: Implement proper async mock cleanup patterns
- **Effort**: Medium (1-2 hours)

#### Missing Test Parallelization Configuration (Created: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: Added `pytest-xdist` but no configuration for optimal parallel execution
- **Impact**: Tests could run faster, CI/CD could be more efficient
- **Solution**: Add pytest configuration for parallel execution and test isolation
- **Effort**: Low (30 minutes)

### Low Priority

#### Missing Pytest Configuration Optimization (Created: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: Could leverage more pytest plugins and configuration
- **Impact**: Developer experience, test reliability
- **Potential Additions**:
  - `pytest-sugar` for better test output
  - `pytest-benchmark` for performance testing
  - `pytest-env` for environment variable management
- **Effort**: Low (1 hour)

#### Testing Guidelines Missing (Created: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: No formal testing guidelines for contributors
- **Impact**: Inconsistent test patterns in future contributions
- **Solution**: Create `TESTING.md` with patterns and best practices
- **Effort**: Low (1 hour)

## Tracking Guidelines

### Debt Classification
- **High Priority**: Affects code quality, maintainability, or reliability significantly
- **Medium Priority**: Improves developer experience or performance
- **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have improvements

### Required Information
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the debt
- **Impact**: How it affects the codebase or development
- **Root Cause**: Why the debt exists (when relevant)
- **Solution**: Specific steps to address the debt
- **Effort**: Time estimate (Low: <1hr, Medium: 1-4hrs, High: >4hrs)
- **Dependencies**: Any blockers or prerequisites
- **Created**: Date when debt was identified

### Review Process
- Review this document monthly
- Update status and priorities based on project needs
- Remove completed items
- Add new debt items as they're identified

## Completion Log

### Completed Items (2025-08-09 Technical Debt Payback)

#### Comprehensive Technical Debt Resolution Session (Completed: 2025-08-09)
**Total Effort**: 6 hours of focused technical debt payback
**Impact**: Eliminated all high-priority technical debt, restored quality gates
**Coverage Improvement**: From failing tests to 91% coverage
**Git History**: 4 focused commits with incremental improvements

#### Asyncio Test Configuration Issues (Completed: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: Tests failing with "asyncio marker not found" errors, missing pytest plugins
- **Solution**: Added asyncio marker to pytest configuration, installed all required pytest plugins
- **Files Fixed**: pyproject.toml (pytest configuration)
- **Plugins Added**: pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock, pytest-cov, pytest-xdist, pytest-httpx, pytest-randomly
- **Effort**: Medium (1 hour)
- **Impact**: All async tests now execute properly

#### Test Mock Issues and Coverage Restoration (Completed: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: Test isolation issues causing failures due to shared fixtures
- **Root Cause**: Shared `context_fetcher` fixture being modified by earlier tests
- **Solution**: Fixed test configuration value mismatches, added proper config reset
- **Files Fixed**: tests/unit/test_context_fetcher.py
- **Result**: 91% test coverage restored, all tests passing
- **Effort**: Medium (2 hours)
- **Priority**: HIGH (was blocking quality gates)

#### Type Checking Issues Already Resolved (Completed: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: Previously reported 27 MyPy errors were already resolved

- **Effort**: N/A (already complete from previous development)

#### Package Naming Inconsistency Resolution (Completed: 2025-08-09)
- **Description**: Mixed usage of `autodoc_mcp` vs `autodocs_mcp` directories
- **Solution**: Removed empty leftover `autodocs_mcp` directory structure
- **Result**: Consistent naming throughout codebase (`autodoc_mcp` for code, `autodoc-mcp` for distribution)
- **Effort**: Low (15 minutes)

#### Long-term Architectural Evolution Plan (Completed: 2025-08-09)
