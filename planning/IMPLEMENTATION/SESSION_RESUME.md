# Session Resume Tracking

This document is automatically updated at the end of each coding session to help you quickly resume work.

## Current Session Status
## What You Were Working On

### Active Tasks
Currently analyzing planning folder structure and creating session resume system.

### Next Actions
1. **Update version references** - Planning docs show v0.3.0 but code is at v0.4.2
2. **Continue expansion phase** - GitHub integration and universal documentation sources
3. **Address remaining test quality** - Mock improvements and type annotations

## Quick Context Switch Guide

### If You're Starting Fresh
1. Read this document first
2. Check `planning/IMPLEMENTATION/current_priorities.md` for strategic context
3. Review `planning/CORE_REFERENCE/RELEASE_VALIDATION_STATUS.md` for technical status
4. Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` to see recent changes

### If You Left Mid-Task
- **Current TODO items** will be listed below
- **Incomplete work** will be noted in "Work in Progress" section
- **Files you were editing** will be listed with line references

---

## Technical State Summary

### Test Status
- **Coverage**: Claims 91% (needs verification against current v0.4.2)
- **Pytest**: All configured with pytest-mock patterns
- **MyPy**: Claims clean (needs verification)

### Production Readiness
- **Security**: URL validation, path sanitization implemented
- **Operations**: Health checks, metrics, graceful shutdown complete
- **Architecture**: Core services, infrastructure layers well-defined

### Known Issues
- Version number mismatches between docs and code
- Some test mock improvements needed (documented in technical_debt.md)

## Session-Specific Notes

### Current Session (2025-08-10)
**Focus**: Analyzing planning folder structure and sync with codebase
**Discoveries**:
- Planning structure is excellent and well-maintained
- Version mismatch: docs claim v0.3.0, git shows v0.4.2
- Technical debt document shows most issues resolved
- Need to verify current test/type status against v0.4.2

### Previous Session Context
Based on git log, previous work focused on:
- Critical bug fixes in response handling
- Testing standards compliance improvements
- Version v0.4.2 release with bug fixes

## Work in Progress
*This section tracks incomplete work that needs continuation*

**None currently** - Session just started

## Files Recently Modified
*Auto-updated with recently modified files*

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Development commands
uv run pytest tests/ -v                    # Run all tests
uv run mypy src/                          # Type checking
uv run ruff check src/                    # Linting
uv run python scripts/dev.py test-scan   # Test dependency scanning

# Git workflow
git checkout -b feature/description       # Create feature branch
git status                               # Check current state
git log --oneline -5                     # Recent commits

# MCP server testing
uv run python -m autodoc_mcp.main       # Start MCP server
```

## Auto-Update Instructions for AI Assistants

When ending a coding session, update this document with:
1. Current git status and branch
2. What was being worked on
3. Next planned actions
4. Any incomplete work
5. Files that were being modified
6. Update the "Last Updated" timestamp

This ensures the next session can immediately understand context and continue productively.## Current Session Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-10 07:07 (Auto-updated by hook)
**Current Branch**: main
**Git Status**: 7 files changed
**Last Commit**: fc71755 chore: merge release/v0.4.2 with critical bug fixes
