# Pre-Release v0.3.0 Remediation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive remediation plan to address all critical security vulnerabilities, production bugs, and missing requirements identified in the technical lead review before v0.3.0 can be deployed to production.

## Critical Issues Summary

**SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**: 2 Critical, 1 High priority
**PRODUCTION BUGS**: 3 Critical severity
**TEST COVERAGE GAPS**: 4 Critical areas
**MISSING REQUIREMENTS**: 3 Production essentials

**Total Estimated Time**: 2-3 development days + 1 day testing
**Team Required**: 2-3 developers + 1 QA engineer

## Work Stream Organization

### Stream 1: Security Fixes (Priority 1 - BLOCKING)
**Duration**: 1 day
**Assignee**: Senior Backend Developer + Security Review
**Files**: `01_security_fixes.md`

### Stream 2: Production Bug Fixes (Priority 1 - BLOCKING)
**Duration**: 1.5 days
**Assignee**: Backend Developer + DevOps Engineer
**Files**: `02_production_bugs.md`

### Stream 3: Test Coverage Remediation (Priority 1 - BLOCKING)
**Duration**: 1.5 days
**Assignee**: QA Engineer + Backend Developer
**Files**: `03_test_coverage.md`

### Stream 4: Missing Requirements (Priority 2 - HIGH)
**Duration**: 1 day
**Assignee**: Full-Stack Developer
**Files**: `04_missing_requirements.md`

### Stream 5: Validation & Deployment (Priority 1 - FINAL)
**Duration**: 0.5 days
**Assignee**: Technical Lead + DevOps
**Files**: `05_validation_checklist.md`

## Success Criteria

**Security**: All CVE-level vulnerabilities resolved and penetration tested
**Reliability**: All production-breaking bugs fixed and integration tested
**Quality**: >80% test coverage with comprehensive error condition testing
**Operations**: Production monitoring, health checks, and graceful shutdown implemented

## Timeline

```
Day 1: Security fixes + Production bug fixes (parallel)
Day 2: Test coverage + Missing requirements (parallel)
Day 3: Final validation, integration testing, deployment preparation
```

## Risk Mitigation

- **Parallel Development**: Streams 1&2, 3&4 can run concurrently
- **Incremental Testing**: Each fix validated immediately
- **Rollback Plan**: Staging environment for final validation
- **Code Review**: All fixes peer-reviewed by technical lead

## Deployment Gates

1. ✅ **Security Gate**: All vulnerabilities resolved + penetration test passed
2. ✅ **Quality Gate**: >80% test coverage + all critical paths tested
3. ✅ **Integration Gate**: All MCP tools working in staging environment
4. ✅ **Performance Gate**: Load testing meets SLA requirements
5. ✅ **Operations Gate**: Monitoring, logging, health checks functional

**Final Approval**: Technical Lead sign-off required after all gates passed
