# Implementation Priorities Guide

## What Are Implementation Priorities?

Implementation priorities are a strategic ordering of development tasks based on:
- **Risk reduction** (tackle the hardest/most uncertain parts first)
- **Value delivery** (get something working quickly for early feedback)
- **Dependency management** (build foundational pieces before dependent features)
- **Testing and validation** (ensure each component works before building on it)

## Why Prioritize Implementation?

### 1. **Risk Mitigation**
- Identify technical challenges early when they're easier to fix
- Validate critical assumptions before investing heavily in dependent features
- Avoid "integration hell" by testing connections between components early

### 2. **Faster Feedback Loops**
- Get a working MVP quickly to validate the core concept
- Allow for course corrections based on real usage patterns
- Build confidence in the architecture through incremental success

### 3. **Resource Efficiency**
- Focus development effort on the most impactful features first
- Avoid building complex features that might be unnecessary
- Enable parallel work streams once foundations are solid

## AutoDocs MCP Server: Recommended Implementation Priorities

### 🚨 **Priority 1: Core Validation (Days 1-3)**
**Goal**: Prove the fundamental concept works

**Tasks**:
1. **Basic Project Setup**
   - Initialize hatch project with dependencies
   - Configure ruff, mypy, pytest
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

2. **Minimal Viable Parser**
   - Implement `PyProjectParser` with basic functionality
   - Parse simple pyproject.toml files
   - Extract main dependencies only (skip optional deps initially)

3. **Simple MCP Integration**
   - Create basic FastMCP server
   - Implement `scan_dependencies` tool only
   - Test with real pyproject.toml files

**Success Criteria**:
- Can scan dependencies from real Python projects
- MCP tool responds correctly in Cursor integration
- Basic error handling works

**Why First**: This validates that the core concept (parsing dependencies via MCP) actually works and integrates properly with Cursor.

### 🔥 **Priority 2: Documentation Fetching (Days 4-7)**
**Goal**: Prove documentation retrieval and formatting works

**Tasks**:
1. **PyPI API Integration**
   - Implement `PyPIDocumentationFetcher`
   - Handle network errors and rate limiting
   - Parse PyPI JSON responses

2. **Version-Based Caching**
   - Implement `VersionResolver` and cache key generation
   - Basic `FileCacheManager` with version-specific storage
   - No time-based expiration

3. **Basic Documentation Tool**
   - Implement simple `get_package_docs` tool
   - Format documentation for AI consumption
   - Test with variety of packages (requests, pydantic, fastapi)

**Success Criteria**:
- Can fetch and cache documentation for major packages
- Version-specific caching works correctly
- Documentation format is useful for AI context

**Why Second**: This proves the documentation retrieval pipeline works before adding complexity like dependency context.

### ⚡ **Priority 3: Graceful Degradation (Days 8-10)**
**Goal**: Make the system robust for real-world usage

**Tasks**:
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Implement graceful degradation in dependency parsing
   - Handle malformed pyproject.toml files
   - Collect and return partial results with warnings

2. **Network Resilience**
   - Robust error handling for PyPI API failures
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Proper timeout handling

3. **User-Friendly Error Messages**
   - Actionable error messages with suggestions
   - Clear indication of partial success vs total failure

**Success Criteria**:
- Works with imperfect project configurations
- Users get helpful information even when some things fail
- No crashes on malformed input

**Why Third**: Real-world Python projects are messy. Making the system robust ensures it's actually usable before adding advanced features.

### 🎯 **Priority 4: Dependency Context (Days 11-14)**
**Goal**: Add the rich context that makes this system powerful

**Tasks**:
1. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Implement `DependencyResolver` with relevance scoring
   - Smart selection of most important dependencies
   - Token budget management

2. **Context-Aware Tools**
   - Implement `get_package_docs_with_context` tool
   - Concurrent dependency fetching
   - Rich context formatting

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Concurrent API requests with semaphore control
   - Efficient context window management
   - Cache optimization for dependency fetches

**Success Criteria**:
- Provides rich context with primary package + key dependencies
- Respects token limits and performance requirements
- Intelligent dependency selection works well

**Why Fourth**: This is the "secret sauce" that differentiates this tool, but it depends on all the previous components working reliably.

### 🧪 **Priority 5: Testing & Polish (Days 15-21)**
**Goal**: Production readiness and comprehensive testing

**Tasks**:
1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   - Unit tests for all core components
   - Integration tests with real PyPI API
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Production Features**
   - Cache cleanup and management
   - Monitoring and logging improvements
   - Configuration validation

3. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Usage documentation
   - Cursor integration guide
   - Troubleshooting guide

**Success Criteria**:
- >90% test coverage
- Meets all performance benchmarks from spec
- Ready for real-world usage

**Why Last**: Polish and comprehensive testing are important but shouldn't delay validation of core concepts.

## Implementation Strategy Benefits

### ✅ **Early Risk Detection**
By building core parsing and documentation fetching first, you'll quickly discover if there are fundamental issues with:
- PyPI API reliability and rate limits
- Documentation quality and format variations
- MCP protocol integration challenges
- Cursor compatibility issues

### ✅ **Incremental Value**
Even after Priority 2, you have a useful tool:
- Developers can scan project dependencies
- Basic documentation lookup works
- Provides immediate value while you build advanced features

### ✅ **Flexible Architecture Validation**
Building incrementally validates your architectural decisions:
- Interface designs prove themselves through use
- Performance characteristics become clear early
- Integration patterns establish themselves naturally

### ✅ **Parallel Development Opportunities**
Once Priority 2 is complete:
- One developer can work on graceful degradation (Priority 3)
- Another can start on dependency context (Priority 4)
- Testing can begin in parallel with feature development

## Alternative: Feature-Complete Approach (Not Recommended)

❌ **Why not build everything at once?**
- **Higher risk**: If dependency context is complex, you might discover fundamental issues late
- **Longer feedback cycles**: Can't test real usage until everything is built
- **Integration challenges**: Harder to debug when everything is new
- **Wasted effort**: Might build complex features that aren't actually needed

## Recommended Development Workflow

1. **Build -> Test -> Deploy -> Get Feedback -> Iterate**
2. **Start each priority with failing tests** (TDD approach)
3. **Deploy to staging environment** after each priority
4. **Get real user feedback** as early as Priority 2
5. **Adjust subsequent priorities** based on learnings

This approach maximizes learning, minimizes risk, and delivers value incrementally while building toward the complete vision.

- Universal architecture supports infinite language additions

### 2. **Market Impact Prioritization**
Focus on maximum developer coverage:
- Phase 1: Python (current) + JavaScript = ~80% of web developers
- Phase 2: Add Go (growing, simple) = validate scaling
- Phase 3: Add enterprise languages (.NET, Java) = enterprise market

### 3. **Technical Risk Management**
- Simple ecosystems (Go) validate architecture before complex ones (Java)
- Reuse proven patterns (GitHub integration) across languages
- Graceful degradation ensures system remains useful during expansion

### 4. **Incremental Value Delivery**
Each phase delivers immediate value:
- Priority 1: Better Python documentation
- Priority 2: Complete second language
