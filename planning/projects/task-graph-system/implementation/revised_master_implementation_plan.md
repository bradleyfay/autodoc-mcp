# Workflow Planning Assistant: Revised Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

### Vision Statement (Revised)
Transform the AutoDocs MCP ecosystem from individual specialized agents into an intelligent **Workflow Planning Assistant** that analyzes user requests, suggests optimal task sequences, and provides guided execution support while respecting Claude Agents/hooks platform limitations.

### Critical Constraint Acknowledgment
Based on expert consultation feedback, a full TASK_GRAPH_SYSTEM as originally specified is **NOT technically feasible** with Claude Agents/hooks only. This revised plan implements a **Workflow Planning Assistant** approach that works within platform constraints while delivering meaningful user value.

### Revised Strategic Objectives
1. **Intelligent Task Analysis**: Analyze complex user requests and suggest optimal task breakdown
2. **Guided Workflow Assistance**: Provide step-by-step guidance rather than automatic orchestration
3. **Context Continuity**: Maintain workflow context across sequential agent interactions
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn from successful workflows to improve future recommendations
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Enhance existing agent capabilities without disruption

### Realistic Success Criteria
- **30% reduction** in multi-step task completion time through better planning
- **80% user satisfaction** with workflow guidance and recommendations
- **Zero regression** in individual agent performance
- **100% reliability** in workflow state management using file-based persistence
- **3-5 sequential tasks** maximum per workflow (platform constraint)

## Technical Constraints & Realistic Scope

### Claude Agents/hooks Platform Limitations

#### Critical Technical Constraints
1. **No True Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Claude Agents/hooks cannot support real concurrent multi-agent execution
2. **File-Based State Only**: Limited to JSON file persistence with no transactional guarantees
3. **Single Session Limitation**: Workflows cannot persist across Claude Code sessions
4. **No Background Processing**: All operations must complete within request-response cycles
5. **Memory Constraints**: Context must fit within single agent token limits

#### Maximum Realistic Scope
- **Sequential Tasks**: 3-5 tasks maximum per workflow
- **Single Concurrent Workflow**: Only one active workflow per session
- **Session-Bound State**: All state lost when session ends
- **File-Based Coordination**: Using proven AutoDocs file management patterns
- **Guidance Over Automation**: Suggest and guide rather than fully automate

### Architecture Shift: Workflow Planning Assistant

Instead of a full orchestration system, we implement:

1. **Workflow Analyzer**: Analyzes requests and suggests task breakdown
2. **Planning Assistant**: Creates structured workflow plans with clear steps
3. **Context Manager**: Maintains workflow state using file-based storage
4. **Progress Tracker**: Tracks completed steps and suggests next actions
5. **Pattern Learner**: Captures successful workflows for future reference

## Revised 3-Phase Implementation Roadmap

### Phase Overview

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Risk Level | Realistic Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Phase 1: Planning Foundation** | 4 weeks | Basic workflow analysis & planning | Low | File-based workflow state |
| **Phase 2: Guided Execution** | 6 weeks | Step-by-step workflow guidance | Medium | Context continuity patterns |
| **Phase 3: Pattern Learning** | 4 weeks | Workflow optimization & learning | Low | Success pattern recognition |

**Total Timeline: 14 weeks (3.5 months)** - 50% reduction from original plan

## Phase 1: Planning Foundation (4 weeks)

**Objective**: Build basic workflow analysis and planning capabilities using file-based state management

### Key Deliverables
1. **Workflow Analyzer Tool**: MCP tool that analyzes complex requests
2. **Planning State Manager**: File-based workflow state persistence
3. **Basic Task Breakdown**: Simple task decomposition algorithms
4. **Integration with Existing Agents**: Non-breaking extensions to current agents

### Success Criteria
- Workflow analyzer successfully processes requests and suggests 3-5 task breakdown
- File-based state management stores and retrieves workflow plans reliably
- All existing AutoDocs functionality remains unaffected
- Basic workflow patterns identified and catalogued

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Workflow Analysis MCP Tool
**Duration**: 1.5 weeks
**Priority**: Critical

```python
@mcp.tool
async def analyze_workflow_request(
    request_description: str,
    request_type: str = "general",
    complexity_hint: int = 5
) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze a complex request and suggest workflow breakdown.

    Args:
        request_description: Natural language description of what user wants
        request_type: Type of request (feature_development, documentation, analysis)
        complexity_hint: User's estimate of complexity (1-10)

    Returns:
        Structured workflow plan with suggested task sequence
    """
```

**Leverages Existing Patterns**:
- Uses `error_formatter.py` patterns for structured output
- Follows `security.py` input validation approach
- Adopts `cache_manager.py` file handling patterns

#### Task 1.2: File-Based Workflow State Manager
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Priority**: Critical

```python
# src/autodocs_mcp/workflow/state_manager.py

class WorkflowStateManager:
    """File-based workflow state management using proven AutoDocs patterns."""

    def __init__(self, workflow_dir: Path):
        self.workflow_dir = Path(workflow_dir) / "workflows"
        self.current_workflow_file = self.workflow_dir / "current_workflow.json"

    async def create_workflow(self, workflow_plan: dict) -> str:
        """Create new workflow with unique ID."""

    async def get_current_workflow(self) -> dict | None:
        """Get active workflow state."""

    async def update_workflow_progress(self, task_id: str, status: str, result: dict) -> None:
        """Update task completion status."""

    async def complete_workflow(self, final_result: dict) -> None:
        """Mark workflow as completed."""
```

**Implementation Approach**:
- Follow `cache_manager.py` file patterns exactly
- Use `security.sanitize_cache_key()` for filename safety
- Implement atomic file operations with temp files
- Add comprehensive error handling using `error_formatter.py`

#### Task 1.3: Task Breakdown Engine
**Duration**: 1.5 weeks
**Priority**: High

```python
class TaskBreakdownEngine:
    """Simple rule-based task decomposition."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.task_patterns = self._load_task_patterns()

    async def analyze_request(self, request: str, request_type: str) -> list[dict]:
        """Break down request into sequential tasks."""

        # Simple pattern matching approach
        if request_type == "feature_development":
            return self._break_down_feature_request(request)
        elif request_type == "documentation_update":
            return self._break_down_documentation_request(request)
        else:
            return self._break_down_general_request(request)

    def _break_down_feature_request(self, request: str) -> list[dict]:
        """Feature development task breakdown."""
        return [
            {"id": "analyze", "description": "Analyze requirements", "agent": "core-services"},
            {"id": "implement", "description": "Implement feature", "agent": "core-services"},
            {"id": "test", "description": "Add tests", "agent": "testing-specialist"},
            {"id": "document", "description": "Update documentation", "agent": "technical-writer"}
        ]
```

## Phase 2: Guided Execution (6 weeks)

**Objective**: Implement guided workflow execution with context continuity between tasks

### Key Deliverables
1. **Workflow Execution MCP Tools**: Tools to execute workflow steps
2. **Context Continuity System**: Maintain context between sequential tasks
3. **Progress Tracking**: Track and report workflow progress
4. **Agent Integration Enhancements**: Optional workflow awareness for existing agents

### Success Criteria
- Users can execute workflows step-by-step with guidance
- Context maintained between sequential tasks within same session
- Progress clearly communicated to users
- Existing agent functionality enhanced but not broken

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 2.1: Workflow Execution Tools
**Duration**: 2 weeks

```python
@mcp.tool
async def execute_workflow_step(
    workflow_id: str,
    step_id: str,
    user_inputs: dict = None
) -> dict:
    """
    Execute the next step in a workflow.

    Returns:
        Step execution result with next step guidance
    """

@mcp.tool
async def get_workflow_progress(workflow_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Get current workflow status and next recommended actions.

    Returns:
        Current progress, completed tasks, and next steps
    """

@mcp.tool
async def skip_workflow_step(
    workflow_id: str,
    step_id: str,
    reason: str
) -> dict:
    """
    Skip a workflow step with reason (for flexibility).
    """
```

#### Task 2.2: Context Continuity Manager
**Duration**: 2.5 weeks

```python
class WorkflowContextManager:
    """Manage workflow context using file-based storage."""

    def __init__(self, context_dir: Path):
        self.context_dir = Path(context_dir) / "workflow_contexts"

    async def store_step_context(
        self,
        workflow_id: str,
        step_id: str,
        context: dict
    ) -> None:
        """Store context from completed step for next step."""

    async def load_workflow_context(self, workflow_id: str) -> dict:
        """Load accumulated context for current workflow."""

    async def merge_step_result(
        self,
        workflow_id: str,
        step_result: dict
    ) -> dict:
        """Merge step result into workflow context."""
```

**File Structure**:
```
~/.cache/autodocs-mcp/workflows/
├── current_workflow.json
├── completed_workflows/
│   └── {workflow_id}.json
└── contexts/
    └── {workflow_id}_context.json
```

#### Task 2.3: Enhanced Agent Integration
**Duration**: 2.5 weeks

Add optional workflow awareness to existing agents without breaking changes:

```python
# Optional enhancement to existing agents
class WorkflowAwareAgent:
    """Mixin for workflow context awareness."""

    async def load_workflow_context(self, workflow_id: str) -> dict:
        """Load relevant workflow context if available."""

    async def contribute_to_workflow(
        self,
        workflow_id: str,
        step_result: dict
    ) -> None:
        """Contribute results to workflow context."""
```

**Integration Strategy**:
- Add workflow context as optional parameter to existing tools
- Existing functionality works identically without workflow context
- When workflow context provided, agents can access previous step results
- Follow existing AutoDocs patterns for backward compatibility

## Phase 3: Pattern Learning (4 weeks)

**Objective**: Implement workflow pattern recognition and optimization

### Key Deliverables
1. **Workflow Pattern Database**: Store successful workflow patterns
2. **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Identify similar requests and suggest proven workflows
3. **Success Metrics Collection**: Track workflow completion and user satisfaction
4. **Workflow Optimization**: Suggest improvements based on historical data

### Success Criteria
- System recognizes similar requests and suggests proven workflows
- Workflow completion rates improve over time
- User satisfaction with suggestions increases
- Pattern database grows with successful workflows

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 3.1: Pattern Database and Recognition
**Duration**: 2 weeks

```python
class WorkflowPatternManager:
    """Manage workflow patterns using file-based storage."""

    def __init__(self, patterns_dir: Path):
        self.patterns_dir = Path(patterns_dir) / "workflow_patterns"

    async def store_successful_workflow(
        self,
        workflow: dict,
        success_metrics: dict
    ) -> None:
        """Store completed workflow as pattern."""

    async def find_similar_workflows(
        self,
        request_description: str,
        request_type: str
    ) -> list[dict]:
        """Find similar successful workflows."""

    async def suggest_workflow_from_pattern(
        self,
        pattern_id: str,
        current_request: str
    ) -> dict:
        """Adapt existing pattern to current request."""
```

#### Task 3.2: Success Metrics and Optimization
**Duration**: 2 weeks

```python
@mcp.tool
async def record_workflow_feedback(
    workflow_id: str,
    success_rating: int,
    time_saved: int = None,
    user_comments: str = None
) -> dict:
    """Record user feedback on workflow completion."""

@mcp.tool
async def get_workflow_suggestions(
    request_description: str,
    request_type: str = "general"
) -> dict:
    """Get workflow suggestions based on successful patterns."""
```

## File-Based Architecture Implementation

### Leveraging AutoDocs Patterns

#### Cache Manager Pattern Adaptation
```python
# Workflow state follows cache_manager.py patterns
class WorkflowFileManager:
    """File management using proven AutoDocs patterns."""

    def __init__(self, base_dir: Path):
        self.base_dir = Path(base_dir)
        self.error_formatter = ErrorFormatter()

    async def store_workflow_state(self, workflow_id: str, state: dict) -> None:
        """Store workflow state atomically."""
        workflow_file = self.base_dir / f"{sanitize_cache_key(workflow_id)}.json"
        temp_file = workflow_file.with_suffix('.tmp')

        try:
            # Atomic write pattern from cache_manager.py
            with temp_file.open('w') as f:
                json.dump(state, f, indent=2)
            temp_file.rename(workflow_file)

        except Exception as e:
            self._cleanup_temp_file(temp_file)
            raise CacheError(f"Failed to store workflow state: {str(e)}")
```

#### Error Handling Pattern
```python
# Error handling follows error_formatter.py patterns
class WorkflowError(Exception):
    """Workflow-specific error with structured formatting."""
    pass

class WorkflowErrorFormatter:
    """Format workflow errors using AutoDocs patterns."""

    def format_workflow_error(
        self,
        error: Exception,
        workflow_id: str,
        context: dict
    ) -> FormattedError:
        """Format workflow errors consistently."""
        return FormattedError(
            severity=ErrorSeverity.ERROR,
            message=f"Workflow {workflow_id} failed: {str(error)}",
            details=context,
            recovery_suggestions=self._get_recovery_suggestions(error)
        )
```

### File Structure Organization

```

## Integration Strategy

### Non-Breaking Enhancement Approach

#### Existing MCP Tools Enhancement
```python
# Example: Enhance existing scan_dependencies tool
@mcp.tool
async def scan_dependencies(
    project_path: str = None,
    workflow_id: str = None  # Optional workflow integration
) -> dict:
    """
    Existing functionality unchanged.
    Optional workflow integration when workflow_id provided.
    """

    # Existing logic unchanged
    result = await existing_scan_dependencies_logic(project_path)

    # Optional workflow integration
    if workflow_id:
        await contribute_to_workflow(workflow_id, "dependency_analysis", result)

    return result
```

#### New MCP Tools for Workflow System
```python
# New tools added to main.py
app.add_tools([
    analyze_workflow_request,      # Analyze and plan workflows
    execute_workflow_step,         # Execute workflow steps
    get_workflow_progress,         # Check workflow status
    skip_workflow_step,           # Skip steps when needed
    record_workflow_feedback,      # Collect user feedback
    get_workflow_suggestions      # Get pattern-based suggestions
])
```
