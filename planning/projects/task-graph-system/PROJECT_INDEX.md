## Project Overview

### Purpose
Task Graph System is an experimental AI agent orchestration framework designed to enable complex, multi-step task execution through intelligent agent coordination and dynamic task graph construction.

### Vision
Create a system where AI agents can collaborate autonomously to break down complex problems into manageable sub-tasks, execute them in parallel where possible, and synthesize results into comprehensive solutions.

### Scope
- **Agent Orchestration**: Multi-agent coordination and task distribution
- **Dynamic Planning**: Adaptive task graph construction based on problem analysis
- **Parallel Execution**: Concurrent task processing with dependency management
- **Intent Recognition**: Natural language to executable task graph translation
- **Result Synthesis**: Intelligent combination of partial results

### Key Research Questions
- [ ] Can AI agents effectively decompose complex problems autonomously?
- [ ] What protocols enable reliable inter-agent communication?
- [ ] How can task dependencies be managed dynamically?
- [ ] What user interfaces best support intention-driven programming?
- [ ] How can system reliability be ensured with autonomous agents?
