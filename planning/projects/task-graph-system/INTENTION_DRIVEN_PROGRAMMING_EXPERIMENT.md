# Intention-Driven Programming: An Experiment in Agent-Based Task Orchestration

**Status**: Conceptual Design & Initial Exploration
**Created**: 2025-08-10
**Context**: Learning from Claude sub-agent capabilities and factory line principles

## The Core Hypothesis

Programming could fundamentally shift from **language-based implementation** to **intention-based orchestration** by leveraging specialist agents that understand how to decompose complex tasks into coordinated, executable work streams.

This represents the next evolution of meta-programming: instead of writing code that generates code, we create agent systems that understand intentions and generate the right code through coordinated specialist work.

## The Factory Line Analogy

The modern industrial revolution succeeded by breaking complex manufacturing into:
1. **Idempotent tasks** - each step produces predictable, repeatable results
2. **Dependency graphs** - understanding what must complete before the next step
3. **Specialist workers** - each person optimized for specific types of work
4. **Orchestration management** - coordination of the entire production line

Programming today resembles pre-industrial craftsmanship: a single developer handling all aspects of implementation. But what if we could apply factory line principles to software development?

## The Technical Vision

### Core Components

#### 1. Task Decomposition Engine
- Analyzes high-level programming intentions
- Breaks them down into discrete, idempotent tasks
- Maps dependencies between tasks based on data flow requirements
- Creates executable task graphs

#### 2. Specialist Agent Ecosystem
**Foundation Agents** (every project needs):
- Project definition and scope analysis
- Architecture and system design
- Quality assurance and validation
- Documentation and communication

**Domain Specialist Agents** (project-specific):
- Core business logic implementation
- Testing strategies and execution
- API design and protocol implementation
- Database design and migration
- Frontend/UI development
- DevOps and deployment
- Security analysis and hardening

**Meta Agents** (system management):
- Agent discovery (what specialists do I need for this project?)
- Agent creation (build new specialists for unique requirements)
- Orchestration management (task graph execution)
- Context coordination (managing data flow between tasks)

#### 3. Orchestration Framework
- **Input/Output Cascading**: Ensuring task outputs become proper inputs for dependent tasks
- **Prerequisite Validation**: Checking all requirements are met before task execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Running independent tasks simultaneously
- **Error Recovery**: Handling failures and retry strategies
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into task graph execution

### Current Implementation Context

This experiment builds on the AutoDocs MCP Server project, which already demonstrates sophisticated agent specialization:
- 8 specialist agents (core-services, mcp-protocol, testing-specialist, docs-integration, etc.)
- Complex multi-agent coordination for documentation and development tasks
- File-based state management and context sharing
- Claude Code integration with hooks and session management

## The Experiment Design

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept
**Objective**: Can current Claude sub-agents effectively decompose and execute a moderately complex programming task?

**Test Case**: "Build a REST API endpoint that fetches GitHub repository information, caches it locally, and provides search functionality"

**Expected Decomposition**:
1. API design and specification
2. GitHub API client implementation
3. Local caching layer (Redis/file-based)
4. Search indexing and query handling
5. Error handling and rate limiting
6. Unit and integration testing
7. API documentation
8. Deployment configuration

**Success Criteria**:
- Task breakdown is logical and dependency-aware
- Each task can be executed independently by appropriate specialists
- Final integration produces working, tested, documented code
- Time to completion is competitive with traditional development

### Phase 2: Orchestration Intelligence
**Objective**: Build meta-agents that can intelligently manage task graphs and agent coordination

**Components to Build**:
- Task decomposition agent that understands programming patterns
- Dependency mapping agent that identifies data flow requirements
- Agent assignment optimizer that matches tasks to specialist capabilities
- Execution coordinator that manages parallel processing and error recovery

### Phase 3: Agent Ecosystem Development
**Objective**: Create a self-improving system that can discover and build new specialist agents as needed

**Components to Build**:
- Agent discovery system (what specialists do I need for this type of work?)
- Agent creation framework (build new specialists for unique requirements)
- Agent capability assessment (what can each agent actually do well?)
- Agent performance optimization (improve specialist effectiveness over time)

## Technical Challenges & Questions

### Context Management
- How do we ensure task outputs are properly formatted as inputs for dependent tasks?
- How do we handle context that spans multiple tasks (database schemas, API contracts, etc.)?
- How do we manage state that persists across task boundaries?

### Quality Assurance
- How do we validate that the task decomposition is correct and complete?
- How do we ensure individual task outputs meet quality standards before passing to dependent tasks?
- How do we handle integration testing when tasks are executed by different agents?

### Error Handling & Recovery
- What happens when a task fails halfway through execution?
- How do we handle cascading failures where one task failure invalidates dependent work?
- How do we implement rollback and retry strategies for complex task graphs?

### Performance & Efficiency
- Is agent coordination overhead acceptable compared to traditional development?
- How do we optimize for parallel execution while respecting dependencies?
- How do we minimize redundant work when multiple tasks need similar context?

## Current Implementation Strategy

### Building on AutoDocs Infrastructure
The AutoDocs project provides an existing foundation:
- **Claude Code Integration**: Native sub-agent system with hooks and session management
- **Specialist Agent Library**: Proven agents for common development tasks
- **File-Based Coordination**: Working patterns for cross-agent context sharing
- **Quality Standards**: Established patterns for testing, documentation, and deployment

### Constraint-Driven Design
**Claude Agents Only**: No external orchestration services - leverage existing Claude sub-agent capabilities
**Hook-Based Coordination**: Use Claude Code hooks for task transitions and validation
**File-Based State**: Manage task state and context through file system (`.claude/dev/`)
**Session-Aware**: Work within Claude Code session lifecycle limitations

### Implementation Approach
1. **Enhance Existing Agents**: Add orchestration capabilities to current AutoDocs agents
2. **Create Meta-Agents**: Build task decomposition and coordination specialists
3. **Prototype Simple Workflows**: Test with 2-3 task sequences before scaling complexity
4. **Measure & Iterate**: Compare intention-driven vs traditional development approaches

## Success Metrics

### Programming Efficiency
- **Time to Implementation**: How much faster is intention → working code?
- **Context Switching Overhead**: Reduced mental load from task coordination
- **Quality Consistency**: More consistent results across different types of tasks

### System Intelligence
- **Decomposition Accuracy**: How well does the system break down complex intentions?
- **Dependency Recognition**: Does it correctly identify task prerequisites and data flow?
- **Agent Assignment**: How effectively does it match tasks to specialist capabilities?

### Developer Experience
- **Intention Clarity**: How precisely can developers express what they want?
- **Progress Visibility**: Can developers understand what the system is doing?
- **Control & Override**: Can developers intervene when the system makes mistakes?

## Next Steps & Open Questions

### Immediate Exploration
1. **Test Current Capabilities**: How well can existing AutoDocs agents handle task decomposition?
2. **Map Dependency Patterns**: What are common data flow patterns in programming tasks?
3. **Prototype Simple Orchestration**: Build a basic task → agent → execution flow

### Research Questions
1. **Granularity Balance**: What's the optimal size for individual tasks?
2. **Agent Specialization**: How specific should specialist agents be?
3. **Context Boundaries**: Where do task boundaries naturally occur in programming work?
4. **Error Recovery**: What recovery strategies work best for programming task graphs?

### Technical Development
1. **Build Task Decomposition Agent**: Meta-agent that understands programming patterns
2. **Create Agent Discovery System**: Identify what specialists are needed for each project type
3. **Design Context Coordination**: Manage data flow and state across task boundaries
4. **Implement Quality Gates**: Validation points between tasks

## Why This Matters

If successful, intention-driven programming could fundamentally change how we approach software development:

- **Faster Development**: Complex features implemented through coordinated specialist work
- **Higher Quality**: Each task handled by agents optimized for that type of work
- **Better Architecture**: System-level thinking built into the decomposition process
- **Knowledge Leverage**: Specialist agents accumulate and apply domain expertise
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers focus on intentions rather than implementation details

This isn't about replacing programmers - it's about amplifying their capability by providing an intelligent orchestration layer that understands how to coordinate specialist work toward programming goals.

The factory line didn't eliminate skilled workers - it made them more effective by organizing their work intelligently. Intention-driven programming could do the same for software development.

## Document Status

**Next Phase**: Prototype task decomposition with existing AutoDocs agents
**Timeline**: Experimental exploration over next 2-4 weeks
**Success Criteria**: Working demonstration of intention → coordinated execution → functional code
