## Parallel Work Streams

### Day 1-2 Parallel Execution
```
Day 1: Security (Stream 1) || Production Bugs (Stream 2)
Day 2: Testing (Stream 3) || Missing Req (Stream 4)
Day 3: Integration (Stream 5) + Final Validation
```

### Dependencies
- **Stream 2** (Production bugs) can start after Stream 1 (Security)
- **Stream 3** (Testing) can run parallel with Stream 4 (Requirements)
- **Stream 5** (Integration) requires all previous streams complete

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex Security Fixes**: Senior developer assigned, extra review time
- **Test Coverage Gaps**: QA engineer dedicated full-time to testing
- **Integration Issues**: Buffer time allocated for troubleshooting

### Schedule Risks
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple streams to reduce total time
- **Incremental Validation**: Daily checkpoints to catch issues early
- **Resource Flexibility**: Team members can support each other if needed

### Quality Risks
- **Comprehensive Review**: Technical lead reviews all critical fixes
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline validates all changes
- **Staging Validation**: Full system tested before production

## Success Metrics

### Daily Success Criteria
**Day 1**: Security vulnerabilities resolved, production bugs identified and started
**Day 2**: >80% test coverage achieved, all production features implemented
**Day 3**: Full integration working, production deployment approved

### Quality Gates
- **Security Gate**: All CVE-level issues resolved
- **Reliability Gate**: 24-hour stability test passing
- **Quality Gate**: >80% test coverage with critical paths tested
- **Operations Gate**: Health checks and monitoring working

## Resource Optimization

### Efficiency Maximization
