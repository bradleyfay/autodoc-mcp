# Current Implementation Priorities

## Executive Status
**Project Phase**: Phase 4 Complete - Production Ready v0.3.0
**Current Focus**: Post-MVP expansion into universal documentation sources
**Release Status**: Production approved with enhanced monitoring (see CORE_REFERENCE/RELEASE_VALIDATION_STATUS.md)

---

## Current Release Status (v0.3.0)

### âœ… PRODUCTION READY
- **Security**: All vulnerabilities addressed (URL validation, path sanitization, input validation)
- **Functionality**: Core documentation fetching and dependency context working
- **Operations**: Health checks, metrics, graceful shutdown implemented
- **Reliability**: Network resilience, circuit breakers, connection pooling complete

### Remaining Quality Items (Non-Blocking)
- Test mock improvements (47 test failures from mock setup issues)
- Type annotation completion (27 MyPy errors in health/observability modules)
- Enhanced integration testing

## Active Implementation Priorities

### ðŸš¨ **PRIORITY 1: Expansion Phase Implementation (Active)**
**Goal**: Universal documentation sources to improve Python experience and prepare for multi-language support

Based on the comprehensive implementation priorities framework (see full details below), we are now in the **Expansion Phase**:

#### **Current Sprint: Universal Documentation Sources (Weeks 1-4)**
Following the strategic expansion plan:

1. **GitHub Integration** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Repository URL extraction from PyPI metadata
   - GitHub API integration for README and examples
   - Content processing and AI-optimized formatting

2. **Read the Docs Integration** (Week 3)
   - RTD URL detection and access
   - Structured API documentation extraction
   - Multi-format support (Sphinx, MkDocs)

3. **Multi-Source Aggregation** (Week 4)
   - Content deduplication and prioritization
   - Concurrent processing with failure isolation
   - Token budget management across sources

#### **Next Phase: Multi-Language Foundation (Weeks 5-8)**
- Universal architecture establishment
- Node.js ecosystem support (package.json, npm registry)
- Validation of cross-language patterns

### ðŸ”„ **PRIORITY 2: Test Quality Completion (Ongoing)**
**Goal**: Complete remaining test infrastructure improvements

#### Remaining Tasks:
- **Mock Pattern Fixes**: Convert remaining 47 test failures to pytest-mock patterns
- **Type Annotation Completion**: Resolve 27 MyPy errors in health/observability modules
- **Integration Test Suite**: Add comprehensive end-to-end testing

#### Success Criteria:
- >95% test pass rate
- Full type coverage
- Real PyPI integration testing

### âš¡ **PRIORITY 3: Deployment Readiness Validation**
**Goal**: Ensure smooth production deployment

#### Tasks:
- Staging environment validation
- Performance benchmarking under load
- Monitoring dashboard configuration
- Production deployment documentation

## Implementation Strategy Framework

### Core MVP Implementation Phases (COMPLETE âœ…)

#### **Phase 1: Core Validation** âœ…
- Basic project setup and CI/CD
- Minimal viable parser for pyproject.toml
- Simple MCP integration with scan_dependencies

#### **Phase 2: Documentation Fetching** âœ…
- PyPI API integration with rate limiting
- Version-based caching system
- Basic get_package_docs tool

#### **Phase 3: Graceful Degradation** âœ…
- Enhanced error handling and messaging
- Network resilience with retry logic
- User-friendly error messages

#### **Phase 4: Dependency Context** âœ…
- Smart dependency resolution and selection
- Context-aware tools with token management
- Performance optimization with concurrent fetching

#### **Phase 5: Testing & Polish** âœ…
- Comprehensive test suite (core coverage achieved)
- Production features (health, logging, monitoring)
- Documentation and integration guides

## Strategic Implementation Principles

### âœ… **Incremental Value Delivery**
Each phase delivers immediate value:
- Phase 1: Basic dependency scanning
- Phase 2: Package documentation lookup
- Phase 3: Robust real-world usage
- Phase 4: Rich contextual intelligence
- Phase 5: Production-ready deployment

### âœ… **Risk-First Development**
- Build core validation before advanced features
- Test integration points early
- Validate assumptions with real usage
- Graceful degradation for robustness

### âœ… **Architecture-Driven Expansion**
Current expansion follows proven patterns:
- Universal foundations benefit all languages
- Market impact prioritization (Python â†’ JavaScript â†’ Go â†’ Enterprise)
- Technical risk management (simple before complex)
- Reusable patterns across ecosystems

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **Main branch**: Production-ready releases only
- **Develop branch**: Active development work
- **Feature branches**: Individual features and improvements
- **Release branches**: Release preparation and validation

### Quality Gates
- Pre-commit hooks: Ruff linting, MyPy checking, file hygiene
- Test coverage: >80% overall, >85% for critical files
- Integration testing: Real PyPI API validation
- Performance benchmarks: <5s response times maintained

### Commit Standards
All commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `refactor:` for code improvements
- `test:` for testing improvements
- `docs:` for documentation updates

---

## Next Session Actions

1. **Continue expansion implementation** following the GitHub integration roadmap
2. **Address remaining test quality issues** with pytest-mock conversions
3. **Validate production deployment** in staging environment
4. **Update RELEASE_VALIDATION_STATUS.md** with current progress
