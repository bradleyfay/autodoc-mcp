# Documentation Site Production Readiness

This folder contains production deployment planning, monitoring, and operational excellence documents that were moved from the docs/assets/ folder to keep the site assets folder focused on actual site assets.

## Files Moved Here

### Accessibility & Compliance
- `accessibility-audit.md` - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance audit and implementation guide

### Performance & Monitoring
- `performance-optimization.md` - Performance analysis and optimization strategies
- `monitoring-analytics-plan.md` - Comprehensive monitoring and analytics implementation plan

### Production Operations
- `production-deployment-procedures.md` - Deployment workflows, maintenance procedures, and incident response
- `production-readiness-summary.md` - Executive summary of production readiness status and deliverables

## Purpose

These documents provide operational guidance and production readiness frameworks for the documentation site but are not site assets themselves. They were moved to maintain a clean docs/assets/ folder that contains only files that should be served with the documentation site (logos, favicons, CSS, etc.).

## Usage

DevOps engineers, site maintainers, and project stakeholders should reference these documents when:
- Deploying to production
- Monitoring site performance
- Implementing analytics and user feedback systems
- Conducting accessibility audits
- Planning maintenance procedures
- Responding to incidents

## Related Folders

- `../../deliverables/` - Contains project delivery summaries and artifacts
