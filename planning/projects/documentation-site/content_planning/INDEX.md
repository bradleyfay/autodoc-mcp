# Documentation Site Content Planning

This folder contains planning documents and templates that were moved from the docs/ folder to keep the site content focused on actual user-facing documentation.

## Files Moved Here

### Content Strategy & Planning
- `DOCUMENTATION_LINKING_GUIDE.md` - Guide for internal linking patterns in MkDocs
- `content-audit-report.md` - Comprehensive content audit against Di√°taxis framework
- `style-guide.md` - Editorial standards and content style guide
- `ux-optimization-plan.md` - User experience improvement strategy
- `visual-communication-guide.md` - Visual design and diagram standards

### Documentation Framework
- `diataxis-templates.md` - Templates for tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference docs

## Purpose

These documents provide the strategic foundation for the documentation site but are not part of the actual site content. They were moved to maintain a clean docs/ folder that contains only files that should be published to the documentation site.

## Usage

Content creators and maintainers should reference these documents when:
- Writing new documentation
- Improving existing content
- Planning site enhancements
- Maintaining editorial consistency
- Optimizing user experience

## Related Folders

- `../production_readiness/` - Contains operational and deployment planning documents
- `../../deliverables/` - Contains project delivery summaries and artifacts
